### Data Description

There are two folders corresponding to either vertical or horizontal polarisation at the TX

Inside each is a series of .mat files labelled with client and access point locations. These are shown in the paper. The mat file also specifies what arm position is used.

These mat files contain several arrays.
There are three corresponding to the directional antenna in three wrist mounted positions.
There is one for the omnidirectional pattern (same for all positions)
There is a final one representing the switching antenna which is the maximum achieved by one of the others to simulate switching.

In these arrays the 36 values are  RX power, one for each ten degree rotation of client in azimuth
